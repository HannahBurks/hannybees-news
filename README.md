HANNYBEE-NEWS ~ Website link - https://hannybee-news.netlify.app/

Hello and welcome to my Hannybee-news react app. This app is a news app that provides articles on three topics (Cooking, Coding and Football). You are able to either view by catergory or view all articles (which you can then select sort by options for). 

There is also the ability to post comments, up and down vote articles and delete any comments posted by the logged in user. In this case, a user has been already logged in and defined for ease of use (Peter Messy - whom you may recognise from Mr Men!) Along with this, I have provided a page with a Weather widget and TFL twitter updates. The data used to create these article posts, comes from a previous API I worked on: https://hannybees-news-app.herokuapp.com/api which contains options to POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE and accepts queries such as topic, sortby and order by. This App was created using Node Version V16.15.1, this is the version I therefore recommend using to run this. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

###npm 'install' - to download all dependencies and imports

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
